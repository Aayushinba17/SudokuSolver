# SudokuSolver
First Project of cpp
in this complete recursion is occuring.. calling for one number and then checking if it is valid or not that if it is following all terms and conditions to be followed while solving sudoku if yes then it will further call another one which is valid and so on. if a number returns false then it will not be added and the loop move forward but if recursion comes out to be true for even one number then whole recursion will true and end..
